# 🏢 FlatFinder Backend

FlatFinder is a modern web-based platform that simplifies the process of finding flats for rent or purchase. This repository contains the **backend server** for the FlatFinder application.

## 🚀 Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, finding suitable accommodation can be time-consuming and challenging. FlatFinder bridges the gap between flat seekers and property owners by offering:

- A user-friendly interface to browse listings
- A direct communication channel between users and property owners
- Secure and efficient storage of property details and inquiries

The backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express**, and it uses **MongoDB** for database operations.
